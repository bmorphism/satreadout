# Distillation — SatReadout, end to end

One line: **a saturating non-Riemannian perceptual readout `f_A(t)=A(1−e^{−t/A})`,
Lean-certified, whose tolerance is one identity across substrates and must be
established per-context from a real discrimination device — done on Earth
(Sentinel-2/OlmoEarth, `Â=0.1537`), its Lean4 Anoma/Geb expression still a draft.**

## The spine (one identity)

    KEY:  f x · f y = a·(f x + f y − f(x+y))          ( = the subadditivity defect )

Pure `exp_add`+`ring`, holds ∀a. Every gate (strict subadditivity, no-midpoint,
no-ε-midpoint, collinear strictness) is its corollary. Non-Riemannian: equality
(additivity along geodesics) never attained ⇒ excluded from large-difference use.

## What stands, by epistemic status

**PROVEN (Lean v4.28, pushed, CI-enforced — not re-run this session):**
- SatReadout gates + KEY identity; axioms = `propext/Classical.choice/Quot.sound`
  only, 6/6 theorems, enforced by `proof-health.yml`. `81a3929`,`85f629d`.

**MEASURED this session (real, falsifiable, reproduced):**
- *Bridge*: `idtol = 64·ε·A` replaces tuned `1e-9`/`1e-6`; KEY float-residual
  `3.55e-15 < idtol` (bb-measured this session; Julia test edited, not re-run).
  CI green (run `27571358117`). `fbff48b` (satreadout, PUSHED) + `e3c403a`
  (Gay.jl `gay`, PUSHED).
- *world://gerbils*: two `color://` kernels (gay:// avalanche identity vs perceptual
  saturating); saturation collapse (gerbils.bb selftest): raw ΔE-spread **12.3** →
  f-spread **0.0067**; Σ≡0 GREEN. `world/gerbils.bb`, `fbff48b`.
- *Color*: colorimetric conversion round-trips to ~1e-7 (invertible, H¹=0); the
  percept (magenta = non-spectral, learned categorical perception) carries H¹≠0.
  Color = gauge section; percept = the orbit; `f_A`'s non-invertibility = the spread.
- *Earth = the device* (`seek on ea`): OlmoEarth-Nano (dim 128) over `world://OLC`,
  Sentinel-2; `world/eo_trit.bb` (selftest GREEN). **Tolerance ESTABLISHED from real
  device data**: `Â=0.1537` (ocean↔urban p95), `a=0.0120`, `b=0.1011` (Otsu valley),
  `idtol=2.18e-15`. Regimes all correct: floor 0.0007→SAME, seasonal 0.066→MAYBE,
  ocean↔urban 0.154→DIFFERENT. Synthetic `A=0.45` falsified. `4f8aa78`,`4f2c9b1`.

**DEFERRED / NOT DONE (named, not hidden):**
- `ToleranceIntent.lean` is a **draft only** (in `BCI_TOLERANCE_INTENT.md`), not
  lake-built. The Geb morphism / Juvix `compileIntent` not written. ⇒ the loop's
  "expressible in lean4 intents of anoma/geb" gate is **open**.
- No live BCI device existed; Earth/Sentinel-2 was the honest substitute device.
- Commits `2c67bea`,`4f8aa78`,`4f2c9b1` are **local, unpushed** (WIP arc).

## Content-H¹ preserved (genuine disagreement, never forced to 0)
- `fp(100000) ≠ a45b…` = .topos-miniature vs Gay.jl fingerprint convention (traced).
- EO crop label approximate: `san_bruno_q*` are MGRS-NW (ocean), not San Bruno
  (crop bug, fixed mid-arc for `ocean_beach.bin`).
- gerbil fur RGB = keeper-eye approximations.
- **`A` is per-context, no universal value**: color `A≈10`, EO-Nano `Â≈0.1537` —
  different substrates, different gauge orbit. This is the magenta/Color lesson and
  *why* the tolerance must be an intent (per-observer `commit`), not a constant.

## GF(3) of the whole arc (measured)
+1 generated (bridge, gerbils, adapter, EO fit) · 0 witnessed (duality, regime
sanity, the per-context gauge) · −1 falsified-and-survived (Riemannian kernel fails
the gate; synthetic A=0.45 refuted by device data; crop bug caught and fixed).
Σ≡0 — and the two open items above keep it honest, not closed.
